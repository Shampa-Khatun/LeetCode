Solution Approach: 

-> Use three pointers starting from the end:

    1. i points to the last valid element in nums1.

    2. j points to the last element in nums2.

    k points to the last position of nums1 (total size m + n).

-> Compare elements pointed by i and j, place   the larger at position k.

-> Move pointers accordingly and continue until all elements from nums2 are merged.

-> This approach merges the arrays in-place from the back to avoid overwriting elements.
